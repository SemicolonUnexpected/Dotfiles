DUAL BOOTING IS PAINFUL

Ill say is again...

DUAL BOOTING IS PAINFUL

However, I will admit it is useful

Unfortunately everyone else is mostly Microsoft based

Basically...
- Once you have installed arch or similar you may need to mount the windows efi partition, e.g. on /mnt/windows
- Then ensure that os-prober is installed 
- Then ensure it is enabled in the grub boot loader. The config is in /boot/default/grub.cfg and the line that needs uncommented is the last one

Here are some useful commands...

# Install grub
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB

# Update the grub config
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
